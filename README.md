# offline-first-react-app

This sample react app provides a simple comparison on how offline first webapps work when offline first feature 
is enabled and disabled in an react app. 

The project consists of two main branches `before_offline` and `after_offline` where `before_offline` branch contains 
the implementation for offline disabled app and `after_offline` branch contains the implementation for offline feature
enabled react webapp.

Both web apps are deployed and hosted in Firebase therefore you can simply check the difference.
